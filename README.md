A website and web-presence for a local craftsman that makes custom works in his garage to display and sell his work.

It was a project that I started when I was in college, but at the time was not able to support due to the rigors of my college workload.

I had made contact with the individual to speak with him in regards to the content and my use of it for GitHub, I wanted him to know what I had planned and make sure he was ok with it. It is my content, but its about him and his work.

He made mention that he loved the site and what I had done, and if I was getting ready to start work, he definatly wanted to get this back going. I'm glad that when we were working together before, I did stay open with him about my school and what I was doing. I found out that trying to develope and keep my courses on track became very difficult, when I approched him with this, and he understood! I hated having to pull off the project, but was ultimatly the right decision...either my school was going to suffer or the client was...neither option was acceptable. That is when I decided that all active development would wait till after I was done in school.

I'm stoked to have the opportunity to readdress this and thankful the client was understanding.
