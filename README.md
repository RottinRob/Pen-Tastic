# Pen-Tastic

A website and web-presence for a local craftsman that makes custom works in his garage to display and sell his work.

It was a project that I started when I was in college, but at the time was not able to support due to the rigors of college.
I had made contact with the individual to speak with him in regards to the content and my use of it for GitHub, I wanted him to know what I had planned and make sure he was ok with it.
He made mention that he loved the site and what I had done, and if I was getting ready to start work, he definatly wanted to get this back going.
I'm glad that when we were working together before, I did stay open with him about my school and what I was doing
